# Autograding with `pytest` and Gradescope

I'll add more help here soon. This is a template repository for creating an autograder package for [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) using the Python testing framework [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html).

Examine `test_roman.py` for examples of how to use [pytest markers](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html) to add Gradescope-specific attributes to test cases.
